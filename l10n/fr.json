        "But Wish Craft might not necessarily make a wish come true, but instead might give you the means to make it come true.": "",
        "Like for the King...\\!\\ He wished for Vaugarde to be kept safe and perfect, so Wish Craft gave him the means to make his wish come true...": "",

        "The book had a lot more than this, like what would happen if multiple people wished for something, or what if two people wished for opposite things...": "",
        "So you can always go back to the locked storage room on Floor 1 to refresh your memory!": "",

        "But the thing is, you seem to be the only one who followed the correct rituals...\\!\\ Maybe that was knowledge you got from where you come from?": "",
        "But the wish you made to the Favor Tree can't be why you're here, right?\\!\\ At least you don't seem to think so.\\!\\ And it's not your party's either.": "",
        "More so because they messed up their rituals, teehee!": "",
        "But, maybe...\\!\\ If a lot of people wished for the same thing, even if the ritual was wrong...\\!\\ Maybe their wish might come true.": "",
        "Which apparently might be what happened...?": "",
        "The Head Housemaiden found out everyone in Vaugarde seems to have wished for the same thing...": "",

        "And...\\!\\ It might be why you're stuck looping in time.": "",
